# Presentation

Hello, this is a presentation for our library management system.

Our project is running on Java17(Seventeen) and the whole build and test process is gradle based.

We have also published the code to github.

To run the process you can check the readme in the file we give.

Next I will start showing our project.

## Menu

When we run the process, a menu appears, where functions 0 to 4 are written by me.

We can execute commands 8 and 9 to display the full data.

Then we can then enter the command 0 to create a new loan, for example:

Once created we can execute command 6 to view the newly added data here.

We can also enter command 1 to renew a loan, for example:

We can also enter command 2 to return a loan, for example:

In addition, our project supports the creation of books by executing command 3.

Finally, the deletion of existing book items can also be done by command 4.

This is a simple preview of our project, thank you for watching.
